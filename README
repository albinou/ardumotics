Introduction
============

Ardumotics is an home automation software plateform running on Arduino (only
tested on Arduino Uno). However, it only depends on avr-gcc so it should run on
any AVR microcontroller.

It is developped with modularity in mind and thus allows to add support for new
devices easily (a "device" can just be a home made printed circuit).

This project is new and still incomplete. Stay tuned!
